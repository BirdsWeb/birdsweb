## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ If you're reading this, it means that you want to see the files of the great and original BirdsWeb, a website about budgies! But theres a problem: some files are in Italian (cuz thats the original version) and are private files that only the developer (me) can see. Thanks for reading!
